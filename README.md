# HeatingUp
## Keep track of your Beruit metrics, because even drinking games deserve some analysis.

### Installation
#### Prereqs:
- Meteor

#### Steps:
- `git clone git@github.com:trezm/HeatingUp.git`
- `cd HeatingUp`
- `meteor run` or `meteor run android` (if you have the android SDK installed)

### So... This is...
Unstable?  You bet.  It's more of an experiment using [Angular-Meteor](http://angularjs.meteor.com/), but it doesn't mean you can't have fun with it


### Should I put sensitive information in this?
Probably not.  I wouldn't at least.

### Can I access this without being a computer nerd?
Sure, just go to [heatingup.meteor.com](http://heatingup.meteor.com).  Again, probably don't but your real password in there.  I won't take it, but who knows what nefarious characters lurk on the interwebs these days.

(Android and iOS coming soon, because really, why not?)
